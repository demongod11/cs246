1. Find the attributes that are neither on the left and right side

2. Find attributes that are only on the right side

3. Find attributes that are only on the left side

4. Combine the attributes on step 1 and 3

5. Test if the closures of attributes on step 4 constitutes all the attributes. If yes it is a candidate key.

6. If not, find the relation exteriors, that is the attributes not included in step 4 and step 2.

7. Now test the closures of attributes on step 4 + one attribute in step 6 one at a time. All those combinations are candidate keys if their closures constitute all the attributes
